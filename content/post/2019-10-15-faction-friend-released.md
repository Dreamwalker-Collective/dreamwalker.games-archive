We are proud to announce that FactionFriend Reborn is ready to assist you in all your Classic adventuring!

We are still working through little logic incongruities, as well as getting the code base updated to use more modern techniques, but it shouldn't crash and burn.

## Known Issues

*Turn-in calculation is too high.* At some point, the value of turn-ins was increased, but Classic put it back to the original values. We will be correcting them in an upcoming release.

*Wastewander Pouches are not counted.* How a goblin missed this, we have no idea.

# What About Retail?

Unfortunately, due to a number of changes in the API on Retail, getting it working there has been very slow going and doesn't bode very well. We are still trying to get it working, but we don't know when or if we'll have a working release ready.
