It's a brand new year, and with it, we have a couple of announcements, including the launching of a brand new project! :tada:

## Faction Friend

First, a quick update on FactionFriend Reborn -- due to the inherently finite nature of Classic and the fact that we've taken a vacation from it, FactionFriend will probably not get any more updates. But that's okay! It shouldn't need any. The factions relating to Naxx are already in place and our crew gave everything a once-over, so it should just work.

We will be glad to work out any bugs that you find, though, and if/when the Dark Portal opens again, we will very likely be back and we'll bring our favorite faction-tracking gadget with us!

## Introducing Tabletop Treasures!

During our travels throughout the Multiverse, we've encountered a wealth of strange and fascinating landscapes, stories, creatures, and people, and we're just _dying_ to share them with you!

We're still putting the final touches on the Trove and still need to start moving things in, but we hope to have it up and running shortly.
